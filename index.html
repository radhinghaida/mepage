                    <p>From 2018 until now, I'm one of informatics engineering student in Institut Teknologi Bandung.
                        Everyday, I wake up and sit in front of my laptop hoping to succeed on this studying process. 
                        I really like pursuing this study especially at Frontend Engineering and UI | UX designing. Hope the best for me!

                    <p>I already love world of football since I was 5 years old! Since then, I always spare my time to watch football whether
                        it's live matches or just highlights on online streaming sites espescially when Chelsea FC and Persib Bandung play. Whenever they
                        play, I will watch them!

                    <h2>Gaming!</h2>
                    <p>I do this thing when I have little more spare time after watching football. I'v been a gamer since a long time ago 
                        though. I like to play anykind of game whether it's First Person Shooter, MMORPG, Strategy, Single-Player, or Multiplayer Games.
                        But, I like sports game better than anything else on the market. FIFA, NBA2k, and Madden NFL are my favorites.

                    <p>After my third year pursuing Informatics Engineering Study, finally I like something spesific like UI | UX Designing.
                        I like it a lot to the point that in a week, I could join 2-3 courses about this speciality! Still not reaching 
                        "good enough" on this skill, but I like it a lot! I'm a man on a mission.

                <h2>Infomatics Engineering Student</h2>
                <p>Hello, I'm Radhin! <br><br>

                    <u>I was born and raised in Bandung, Indonesia.</u> Since I was born, I never leave this 
                    beautiful city. Bandung is a unique city in Indonesia. People remember this city 
                    for it's contribution in world peace by hosting the Asian-African Conference on 1955.
                    Maybe that's why this city is gathered by lovely and peace people.<br><br>
                    
                    Currently, <u>I'm pursuing my bachelor degree of Informatics Engineering at Institut 
                    Teknologi Bandung.</u> When I first decided to take this major, I don't really know 
                    about Informatics Engineering itself. But, the more I learn about this major, the more 
                    I love Inforamtics Engineering and currently, I found what makes me want to stay
                    at this major. <u>UI | UX Designing</u> especially about the User Experience. I found it 
                    interesting about how people think about something people serve for them and how user's 
                    mind react when they see something. Maybe, being raised by my lovely parents who pursue
                    Psychology have some parts about it too.<br><br>
                    
                    Outside studying Informatics, I<u> like football a lot!</u> Whether It's playing or watching,
                     I'm always down to football. Besides that, I like to play <u>video games</u> so much! I'm not 
                    wasting all my time on it but when I have some spare time, I like to refresh my
                    mind and soulbyn playing video games. I like to play it with my friends better though.<br><br>
                    
                    By the way, I always love to meet people out there! So, reach out to me and let's talk!
